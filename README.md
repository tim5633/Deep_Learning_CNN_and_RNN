## Overview
In modern industrial applications, sensors are used to observe key machine characteristics. These can help detect slight deviations and issues to avoid major system failures through targeted repairs while keeping maintenance costs under control.

Such sensors are critical in the operation of wind turbines. Due to fluctuating winds that can negatively impact the turbines and the high costs of maintenance, specifically for offshore turbines, sensor readings need to be reliably converted into an operating mode. That is, given the sensor readings over time, we want to know whether the turbine is operating correctly or whether one of several issues is present. If issues are detected (reliably), targeted efforts can be made to alleviate them before a major system failure occurs.
